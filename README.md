# Crypto Order Book

TypeScript / React / Material-UI view of the https://www.cryptofacilities.com/
order book. This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Libraries

- TypeScript was chosen to ensure code correctness and minimal errors
- React was chosen due to the need for a real-time updating data-driven interface
- Material-UI was chosen to have ready-use cross-browser friendly components, and for its excellent JSS styling system for custom styles
- Prettier and ESLint were added to ensure consistent code that follows best practices

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React
in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
